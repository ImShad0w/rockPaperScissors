//What do we need to do?

//Create a random number generator between 1 and 3 
//For each number assign a constant like rock papper or scissors
//Then create an if loop that will get the number that we will input against the computerchoice
//Create another if loop for comparing the values to see the winner e.g if our number or input is rock and computer generates paper it will have a point
//Else we have a point


//Random number generator between 1 and 3
function randomNumber(){
    let randomInt = Math.floor(Math.random()* 3);
    console.log(randomInt);

}
//For each number assign a variable
const rock = 0
const scissors = 1
const paper = 2



//Create a math operation that will substract the input user value from the machine value
